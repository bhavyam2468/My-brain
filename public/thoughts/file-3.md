# The Unbearable Weight of Unrequited Emotions

He: I can't hold it anymore. I can't keep pretending like I'm fine, like this doesn't **eat me alive** every single day. I **love** you. I fucking love you, and it's not some shallow, fleeting, dumb crush. It's not something I can just shake off or bury somewhere like it's no big deal. It's in **every breath** I take, **every thought** I have, **every second** I'm around you—or even not around you!

You're in my **head**, you're in my **heart**, you're in my goddamn **dreams**, you're **everywhere**! Even when I'm staring at an empty wall, just trying to breathe, I see you. I can't **escape**! I can't run, I can't hide, I can't even close my eyes without you being right there in front of me, **haunting** me, driving me absolutely **insane**! You've taken over every inch of me, every corner of my mind, and no matter how hard I try to fight it, you're still there! It's **maddening**—it's **unbearable**—and I don't know what the hell to do anymore.

And I know, okay? I know you don't feel the same—I know that. But do you even understand what it's like to **carry this around**? To feel like you're **drowning** in your own emotions every damn day, and no matter how hard you try to move on, it just doesn't go away? You're in my head, you're in my heart, you're fucking everywhere, and I can't stop it. I've **tried**. God knows I've tried, but it's **impossible**.

And I'm not asking you to feel the same or change your mind or whatever—I just… I needed to say this because if I don't, if I keep **holding it in**, I'm going to **break**. Completely. You might have just lost a beautiful future you could have had, but you know what I lost? I lost **everything**. Even the cruel present I was barely surviving in. And I'm sorry if you feel it, but I don't blame you for anything. It was just the thoughts lingering in my brain, and you just did a common courtesy of helping someone not die by listening to them. I'd still owe a favor to you, forever probably, if I don't get a chance to be with you in the future. But still, **thanks a lot**, for being here and listening to the real me.
