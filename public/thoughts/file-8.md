# The Contradictions of Connection

Love is just a **choice**, but love isn't just a choice. It's a decision that isn't entirely a decision, a feeling that isn't merely a feeling. Love is both **deliberate** and accidental, a moment and a lifetime, something you choose and something you can't help but choose. You can't define it because it's not **definite**. Love is just as basic as how spontaneous you are, yet just as advanced as how much you overthink. It's just as simple to express as it is complex to understand. Love is joy and pain, chaos and calm, fleeting and eternal, a **whisper** and a roar, all at once. It's both something and nothing.... and everything in between.

## Why do i want a girlfriend?

Look, I know people might not get it. Even I don't get it fully, you know? Why I need... not just want, but **need** a girlfriend. It's not just about having someone to call "mine" or showing off a relationship on Instagram. It's deeper than that, more raw, more tangled. Like...

I want to **hug** her. I don't mean a random, polite hug where you pat someone's back and step away. I mean holding her tight, burying myself in that embrace for an hour without letting go. I want her to know that I'm here and feel her presence telling me the same. There's a kind of comfort in that physical closeness, like the world outside can fall apart, but in that moment, we are **safe**.

And I want to cry. God, I want to cry. But the tears they just don't come out. Not with friends, even though I know they won't judge me. That's just not who I am with them, you know? I'm the fun, happy guy. The one who shrugs it off and cracks jokes. Im sure id be same with her too, but with her... I think I could just let go either. Be messy, broken, **vulnerable**, and she wouldn't love me any less. And that thought... it's priceless.

It's also about **company**, having someone to just be with. Like when I watched a movie alone. I had these jokes ready in my head, but there was no one to share them with. And it sucked. It genuinely sucked. The world felt quieter, lonelier. I need someone by my side, not to complete me but to witness life with me. Because what's the point of adventures if you're the only one there to see it? The destination, the journey... it all means nothing without the right company.

And love... love isn't just a cliché to me. It's this burning **desire** to care for someone, to be there when they're vulnerable, to listen to their fears, to share in their dreams. I want to be that person who holds her hand when life gets messy and chaotic, and she knows I'm not going anywhere, she knows she could blindly trust me, and everything would be just fine. I want to feel hopeful because of her and be the reason of her hope, together. And it's not just about what I can give... it's about being wanted, being someone's **priority**. Knowing that someone dreams about you, thinks about you, cares about you without conditions. Knowing that after countless hours of stress, countless days of discomfort and countless years of problems, there is someone out there. waiting. waiting to help you heal, to hear you out and to make you feel content.

I get that friends are important, and yeah, I have amazing friends... but it's not the same. I can't cry on their shoulders the same way. I can't hold them in countless hugs or share that unique, raw **connection**. I don't want to compromise by pretending friendship can replace this. It can't. And it never will.

I guess all these things are connected, you know? The hugs, the tears, the love, the companionship; it's not one reason. It's a **foundation**, a collection of reasons building up like a storm. And I've tried denying it, telling myself I'm fine alone, but the truth is... I'm not. I need that connection. I crave it in ways that are hard to put into words.

Does that make sense?

## If i generalise, what's the characteristic of a female that makes me develop a crush on her?

I guess I’m drawn to someone who feels real; soft, natural, and effortlessly beautiful to me without needing to try too hard. It’s not about perfection or flawless looks. It’s about that quiet authenticity, something comforting that you just feel when you see it. I want someone whose presence is gentle but strong in its own way, with a face that lights up when she smiles and eyes that have their own kind of story.

There’s this thing about skin.... I don’t know how to explain it, but I like when it’s natural, soft, and just... alive. Not rigid or polished. I know it sounds weird, but there’s something beautiful about that. It’s not about wanting someone fragile or weak; I’m not into dominating anyone. I actually prefer being the one who follows her lead, letting her make decisions while I just stand there, ready to hold her whenever she wants to let go for a moment.

I love the idea of being able to completely wrap her in my arms, where every hug feels like this silent, safe connection. I’d love if she wore my shirts sometimes, just for those cozy, casual moments. She doesn't need to look a certain way all the time... just be herself, minimal and authentic. That’s the kind of beauty I admire.

It’s not just about physicality, though. I want that balance between her being strong and decisive while still melting into me when things get overwhelming. Someone who has that grace, intelligence, and subtle charm that makes you feel lucky just standing next to her. And yeah, maybe it’s a bit idealistic, but I know I’d love her in all those tiny, unspoken ways that just make everything feel right.
