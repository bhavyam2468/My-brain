# When Love Meets Responsibility

# A Choice, Between Us  

The room was heavy with tension, both of them teetering on the edge of an argument that neither wanted but both felt inevitable. She was pacing now, her hands gesturing wildly as she spoke, her voice rising with every sentence.  

**“You think this is easy for me?”** she snapped, her face flushed with anger and tears. **“You’re acting like I haven’t thought about all of this already. Like I haven’t imagined every single scenario in my head!”**  

*“I’m not saying it’s easy—”* he started, but she cut him off.  

**“No, you’re just saying I’m emotional and irrational. That I can’t make my own decisions without someone else stepping in to guide me!”**  

His own frustration flared, his voice sharpening.  

**“Because you’re not thinking clearly! You’re letting your emotions control everything!”**  

She froze, her eyes blazing as she rounded on him.  

**“And what are you doing, huh? Acting like some kind of heartless robot? Pretending this doesn’t affect you, too?”**  

**“I *am* affected!”** he yelled back, stepping closer to her. **“But one of us has to keep their head on straight, and it sure as hell isn’t you right now!”**  

The words stung, and she recoiled, her lips trembling with suppressed emotion.  

**“Maybe we should talk to an adult about this,”** she said, her voice wavering but defiant.  

That was the last straw for him. His jaw clenched, and he exhaled sharply, shaking his head.  

**“Babe, you need to be selfish sometimes, okay? If you can’t take a decision on your own, then how do you think you’re capable of taking responsibility for a child? Don’t look for a counselor or anyone else to swoop in and fix this. We don’t have time for that, and honestly, it’s not their place.”**  

Her breath hitched, and she glared at him, her fists clenching.  

**“You’re unbelievable,”** she spat.  

He stepped forward, his tone softening but still firm.  

**“Listen to me. This is about *us*. No one else. Be selfish. Think about yourself, your life, your body. Sure, involve me if you want, but no one else. Imagine you decide to keep this baby because someone else told you to. Twenty years from now, our child could grow up and make choices we aren’t proud of—because we weren’t ready to be good parents. Your greatest regret wouldn’t be that you were a bad parent; it’d be that you let someone else meddle in a decision that should’ve been ours alone.”**  

She opened her mouth to argue, but her voice cracked, and she turned away, trembling with anger and sadness.  

*“You don’t get it,”* she whispered.  

**“Then help me get it,”** he said, stepping closer.  

When she spun around to face him again, her tears were falling freely now.  

**“You don’t get it because you don’t *feel* it! It’s not your body! It’s not you who’ll feel empty after this! *I* will!”**  

Her voice cracked into a scream as she broke down, and he was in front of her in an instant, pulling her into his arms. She resisted, trying to push him away, her fists pounding weakly against his chest, but he held her tightly.  

*“Let me go,”* she sobbed, but her protests were losing their strength.  

**“Never,”** he murmured, his voice steady and calm. **“I’m not letting you go. Not ever.”**  

Eventually, she melted into his embrace, her sobs muffled against his chest as she clung to him.  

**“I want the baby,”** she choked out. **“I don’t care about anything else. *I want it.*”**  

He pulled back slightly, cupping her tear-streaked face in his hands.  

**“I know you do,”** he said gently. **“But let’s talk this through, okay? Just hear me out.”**  

He guided her back to the couch, holding her hands as they sat down.  

**“Because this isn’t just about love,”** he continued. **“It’s about making the right choice for our future.”**  

Her silence gave him the chance to continue, and he seized it.  

**“We have enough time—one day is more than enough. We don’t need to talk to anyone else. We just need to weigh the pros and cons together. If the decision is in favor, we’ll keep the baby. If it isn’t, we won’t.”**  

She opened her mouth to protest, but he held up a hand.  

**“Just listen for a second, okay? The cons are more, and you know it. We’re still in the initial stages of life, just figuring things out. You’re 18. We’re not mature or responsible enough to raise a child. Heck, we don’t even know how to cook properly. I can barely take care of myself sometimes.  

We both have a long future ahead of us—a list of career paths and dreams we want to achieve. We won’t have the time to raise a child properly, not with school and everything else. I don’t want you to drop your education so early, and I hate the idea of daycares. We could always have another baby when we’re ready, but right now? Right now isn’t a good time.”**  

He paused, searching her face for a reaction, but she only stared at him, her expression unreadable.  

So he pressed on.  

**“Making a baby like this, before we’re ready, could have serious consequences. I don’t want to look back and regret that we sabotaged our future and even couldn’t give our child the life they deserved.”**  

She sniffled, her lip trembled, and she whispered, *“But what if I can’t get over it? The guilt, the sadness…”*  

He cupped her face gently, his thumbs brushing away her tears.  

**“You won’t have to bear that alone. I’ll be with you every step of the way. And I’ll make sure—I promise you—that the sadness doesn’t consume you. You know why? Because I’ll cancel it out with happiness. Immense happiness.”**  

Her brows furrowed, confused. *“What do you mean?”*  

He smiled softly.  

**“I’ve got something big in mind. Really big. So big that you’ll think the abortion was the best decision we ever made. So big that you’ll believe it was the right choice for us, for our future.”**  

She blinked, a flicker of curiosity breaking through her sadness. *“You… you have a surprise?”*  

He nodded. **“But you’ll have to trust me.”**  

And she did. Despite the pain, despite the uncertainty, she clung to the love she felt in his words, his actions.  

They went together to the clinic, her hand gripping his tightly as the procedure was done.  

When it was over, she sat in the car, silent and somber, her thoughts heavy. He looked at her, concern etched on his face.  

**“Are you okay?”**  

She shook her head, her voice barely a whisper. *“I feel… empty. Like I just lost a part of myself.”*  

He leaned over and hugged her tightly.  

**“I know. But it’s going to be okay. Do you want to know the surprise now?”**  

She sniffled, managing a small nod. *“Please.”*  

He got out of the car and knelt before her, pulling out a small velvet box. Her breath caught as he opened it, revealing a sparkling ring.  

**“Marry me,”** he said softly. **“Let’s start this life together, build it the right way. Let’s make a family when we’re ready, and until then, let’s be each other’s family.”**  

Tears spilled down her cheeks again, but this time they were tears of joy.  

**“Yes,”** she whispered, her voice shaking. **“Yes, I’ll marry you.”**  

And in that moment, amidst the pain and the hope, they found their new beginning.
