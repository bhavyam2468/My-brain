Selective Outrage

An analysis of how society inconsistently applies moral standards to different types of controversial content

# The Hypocrisy of Public Morality

Ranveer Allahbadia asked a **controversial** question on a comedy show, and the internet lost its collective mind. He posed a hypothetical question:

> "Would you rather watch your parents have s**x every day or join in once to stop it?"

And boom... everyone went **feral**. Instead of focusing on actual derogatory remarks made about women's bodies in the same episode, they decided Ranveer's question was the ultimate **moral crime**. 

## Selective Outrage is a Joke

This society is an absolute joke. People pick and choose what to get **offended** by as if they have some divine authority on morality. You can casually throw around certain insults without anyone batting an eye... you can fat-shame people, laugh at racist jokes about black folks, but the moment someone makes a hypothetical joke involving parents... BAM... national **outrage**. 

- **Fat jokes?** - Acceptable.
- **Racist jokes?** - Shrug.
- **Hypothetical question about family dynamics?** - CANCEL HIM.

Oh, suddenly parents are sacred untouchable beings but fat people aren't? Black people aren't? So it's okay to make derogatory jokes about someone's body or skin tone but God forbid you mess with some imaginary relationship dynamic?

## The Real Problem? Hypocrisy

And here's the best part... they don't even care about actual offensive content. In that same episode, there was a dude making a literal derogatory comment about women, and it was regarded as a JOKE. Nobody said a damn thing. Nope... let's all dogpile on Ranveer because it "doesn't suit his **personality**." 

Who are you to decide his personality? Oh, he's supposed to be this perfect **inspirational** figure because some idiots put him on a pedestal? Guess what... he's a human being, not your programmed robot designed to never make jokes or express emotions.

## The "Modi Blame Squad" is Back

Then comes the Modi blame squad... because obviously everything wrong in this world is Modi's fault, right? 

> Ranveer makes an edgy joke... "WHY DID YOU GIVE HIM AN AWARD... DISAPPOINTING."

Like what... is Modi supposed to be an **astrologer** now? Is he supposed to predict that Ranveer would ask this question in the future? By that logic, if someone else does something terrible tomorrow... guess what... it's Modi's fault too.

## This Generation = Fragile Crybabies

And don't even get me started on the same people who are so "offended" by this question... these are the same people who sit around asking equally **inappropriate** hypothetical questions.

> Nobody's making fun of your family... it's a hypothetical question meant to mess with your brain. You're supposed to **empathize** with it, not have a meltdown and cry about how your precious morals are shattered.

This generation is a bunch of fragile, whining losers who just want to be offended by every little thing while being the most insensitive pricks themselves.

## The Death Threats? Seriously?

Dude, this whole situation is just spiraling out of **control**. Someone tweeted that Ranveer and others involved should be sentenced to death. Like... really? Death for a controversial question on a comedy show? The world has lost its mind. 

Meanwhile, FIRs are being lodged, people are demanding police **investigations**, and the entire country is acting like this is India's biggest crisis right now. 

- **AQI issues in Delhi?** - Nah, who cares?
- **Religious tensions?** - Not important.
- **Unemployment and inflation?** - Whatever.
- **A joke on a comedy show?** - NATIONAL EMERGENCY!

## Freedom of Speech? Dead.

Look, I'm not saying what Ranveer did was okay. Fine... it was in bad taste, I get it. But **freedom** of speech is a thing, or at least it should be. Instead of dragging him through the mud and calling for his head, how about offering constructive criticism?

> "Hey, maybe dark humor about parents isn't the move."

But nope... let's **cancel** him, destroy his entire career, and make sure he never steps foot on a public platform again.

## The **Hypocrisy** is Insane

Society preaches mental health awareness, empathy, and forgiveness... but when someone's in the spotlight, they can't make a single mistake without being crucified. We act like we want people to grow, but in reality, all we want is blood.

Ranveer has a life, a career he's built from scratch, and one bad joke shouldn't wipe it all out. Criticize him, sure... but this death penalty-level outrage? **Get a grip.**

## India’s Priorities Are a Joke

Oh, of course! India has solved every single problem in the country…

- **Corruption?** Gone.
- **Pollution?** Cleanest air in the world.
- **Justice system?** Works like a dream.

Oh wait... no, none of that is true. Instead, the entire nation is up in arms over a comedy show. The media is foaming at the mouth, politicians are pretending to be outraged, and everyone is acting like a joke is the worst thing to happen to India.

## The Real Scandal? IGL Ban Demands

AND NOW these All Indian Cine Workers or whatever ₹ucking wannabe moral police force are demanding that **IGL be shut down completely**?! 

> BRILLIANT IDEA! 

Yeah, let’s destroy a platform that has helped underground rappers, young artists, and struggling talents gain recognition. Let’s completely ₹uck over an entire community because some people got their feelings hurt. 

But oh, you know what’s still running strong?

- **ALT Balaji**
- **ULLU**
- **All those third-grade, softcore porn production houses**

No outrage there? No demands to ban those platforms that objectify women for profit? Oh but IGL? No no, that’s where we draw the ₹ucking line.

## The Bottom Line

> **I SWEAR TO GOD, I AM SURROUNDED BY THE BIGGEST ₹UCKING IDIOTS TO WALK THIS PLANET.**

Every single time I think people can't get dumber, they prove me wrong. This country is **allergic to common sense**. I WANNA ₹UCKING SCREAM!!!!!

Now, if I put a f₹₹king flaming hot iron rod right there and straight-up tell you, 

> "That sh₹t’s scorching, don’t even think about touching it,"

but your dumbass intrusive mind still goes,

> "Hmm, I wonder how hot?"

and you burn yourself—HOW THE F₹₹K IS THAT MY PROBLEM? 

I TOLD YOU my content is offensive. It ain’t for you. It’s f₹₹king subscription-based. You had to buy it, steal it, whatever the f₹₹k you did—but **YOU** chose to watch it. **YOU** got offended. And now you wanna end it? Destroy it? Cancel me?

Keeping that flaming rod there ain’t illegal. **That’s my career, my f₹₹king life.** And you think I’m gonna stop just 'cause you couldn’t control your dumbass curiosity?

No, I’ll come up and stick that rod up your ass, bitch.

**F₹₹k that. F₹₹k you. Deal with it.**
