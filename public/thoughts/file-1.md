# Personal Choice and Society's Interference

**Life**, in its simplest form, is just a **series of moments** strung together. Yet society insists on measuring it in **years**, as though the longer you exist, the more **valuable** your existence becomes. But isn't the true measure of a life its **depth**, not its length? Imagine someone who lives fifty years, their days filled with **adventure**, **joy**, and **fulfillment**—a life that feels complete. Now, imagine someone who lives to ninety, confined to a bed, **shackled** by medications, **robbed** of the simple pleasures they once cherished. Why is it that we honor the latter more? Why do we cling to the **illusion** that longevity is synonymous with **meaning**?

The world is obsessed with this idea of "**more**." More years, more milestones, more time to chase something undefined. But what if someone feels they've already **caught** it? What if they've painted their **masterpiece**, played their **symphony**, or written their **story**? Not every book needs a sequel, not every melody needs another verse. A short, **vibrant** life will always be more **enviable** than a long, drawn-out existence devoid of **purpose** or joy.

But let's not confuse this with the discussion of death—that's a different debate altogether. Let's talk about **control**, about the **right to decide**.

## Society's Interference

Society loves to weigh in on **personal matters**, doesn't it? From the clothes we wear to the partners we choose, it feels entitled to dictate the terms of our existence. But when it comes to the question of life and death—the most **personal decision** there is—society somehow believes it has a stake. It will cry, "But we need to protect life! Life is **sacred**!" Sacred to whom? Certainly not to the individual who feels they've reached their **conclusion**.

And what has society done to earn this right? Was it there during every **sleepless night**, every **quiet victory**, every **crushing defeat**? Did society hold their hand through their pain or share in their joy? No. Society is an **abstract observer**, a bystander that does nothing but critique. And now, it has the **audacity** to believe it can interfere in the ultimate choice. Let me be clear: society has **no right** to interfere. It shouldn't ethically even suggest a course of action, let alone control it.

## Influence: A Longer Question, A Shorter Answer

Now, let's consider a more **complicated question**, one that even I might be tempted to agree with at first glance. What if normalizing this choice leads to **unintended consequences**? What if it inspires others to follow suit? What if someone, somewhere, sees a person make this decision and thinks, "If they can, why can't I?"

It's a valid question. **Influence** is powerful, often unpredictable. But here's the punchline: Is it really the responsibility of the individual to police the interpretations of others? If someone watches a **violent movie** and decides to imitate it, do we blame the filmmaker? Or do we acknowledge the **agency** of the viewer? A person who chooses to end their story doesn't owe their existence to prevent someone else's bad decisions. Influence is a **byproduct** of life, not its purpose.

## Loved Ones: The Emotional Weak Spot

Of course, there's the matter of **loved ones**—the eternal anchor in this debate. This is where my argument falters, where it becomes less resolute. Love isn't purely logical; it's deeply **emotional**. When someone chooses to leave, they're not just making a decision for themselves—they're leaving behind waves of **grief** that ripple through the lives of those who cared for them.

But even here, there's **nuance**. If someone truly loves you, wouldn't they want to understand? Wouldn't they want to respect your sense of **closure**, your **peace**? It's a tough ask, no doubt. But what if, through honest conversation, you explained your perspective, listened to theirs, and still found no compelling reason to stay? Isn't love about **acceptance**, even of the hardest truths?

## Fulfillment: The Infinite Offer

There's another argument that life's defenders love to wield: "What if something better is coming? What if the next chapter holds the **fulfillment** you didn't know you needed?" It's a tempting notion, isn't it? The promise of something just out of reach.

But life isn't a **guarantee**—it's a **gamble**. Imagine you're at a feast, and you've eaten your fill. The host offers you another dish, saying, "This might be the best one yet!" But you're already **satisfied**. You don't need more, and you don't want more. Why should you be forced to keep eating just because the kitchen isn't closed yet? Sometimes, **enough is enough**.

But then, I ask—so what? What's the worst that could happen? Eight billion people choose to leave. The planet would **survive**. The universe wouldn't **collapse**. Life would go on in ways we can't imagine, just as it has for billions of years. The normalization of autonomy isn't the end of humanity; it's the recognition that we don't **owe** our existence to anyone or anything.

## The Final Argument

Ultimately, this debate isn't about **death**. It's about **control**. About the right to define what makes a life worth living—and, by extension, what makes it worth ending. Society can debate, loved ones can grieve, and philosophers can theorize. But in the end, the choice belongs to the **individual**.

Life isn't sacred because it's long. It's sacred because it's **ours**. And no one—no society, no system, no loved one—has the right to take that away.
