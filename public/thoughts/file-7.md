# Beyond Belief: The Rational Mind

So here we are again, having the same tired **conversation**.

Let's get this straight: atheism doesn't claim to know everything; it simply refuses to fill the gaps in our knowledge with "God did it" and call it a day. Theists argue that atheism is **illogical** because we "can't explain everything." Sure, we don't know what caused the Big Bang yet, but here's the thing—they don't know either. They just slap the "God" sticker on it and pretend they've won. That's not an answer; that's intellectual **laziness**.

Take the cosmological argument, for example. "Everything has a cause, so the universe must have one too." Sounds convincing—until you ask, "And who caused God?" Suddenly, the rules change. "Oh no, God is uncaused! He exists outside of time and space!" Convenient, isn't it? It's like saying, "You can't sit at this table unless you're wearing a hat—but my imaginary friend doesn't need one because, uh, he's **special**." If God can be eternal and uncaused, why not the universe itself? You don't get to make arbitrary **exceptions** just to prop up your argument.

And let's not forget the moral argument. This one's my favorite. Apparently, without God, we're all just soulless monsters waiting to rob banks and commit crimes. First of all, that's **insulting**. If the only thing keeping you from being a psychopath is your fear of divine punishment, you're not moral—you're just scared. Morality isn't a divine gift; it's a product of **empathy**, social evolution, and the understanding that actions have consequences. People don't avoid murder because a deity told them not to; they avoid it because it's wrong and destructive to society. Simple as that.

Then there's the classic design argument. "Look at the complexity of the human eye! Surely, it must have been designed!" Really? That's your argument? Because I can look at this complex, beautiful **motherboard** and not understand it, does that mean God made it too? By your logic, everything complicated and misunderstood must be divine. But here's the kicker: the complexity of the eye doesn't prove design—it proves **evolution**. If someone actually took a biology class instead of Sunday school, they'd know the human body is riddled with inefficiencies and flaws. From our backwards retinas to our fragile spines, evolution isn't perfect—it's just good enough to survive. That's not the hallmark of a designer; it's the messy reality of natural selection.

And then there's the God of the Gaps. This is where theists really shine. "We don't know what caused the Big Bang, so it must be God." Really? That's the same logic people used thousands of years ago when they didn't know why the sun rose and thought Apollo pulled it across the sky. Or when they didn't understand lightning and assumed Zeus was throwing **tantrums**. Every single time science fills a gap, your God gets smaller. But here's the difference—once science declares the facts, they don't change. You know what does change? Your questions. Think of it this way: if all the science books and all the religious texts were vanished from existence right now, in the next hundred or couple thousand years, the facts, the science, would be back—exactly the same. But I can bet the religious texts would be changed by a lot. God isn't an explanation—it's a **placeholder** for ignorance.

So what do we have left? Faith. That's what this all boils down to, doesn't it? When logic fails, and evidence is lacking, you fall back on "faith." "I just feel God's presence." Great for you, but feelings aren't **facts**. I can feel like I'm a billionaire; that doesn't make it true. Faith isn't a virtue; it's a surrender. It's saying, "I don't need evidence. I don't need logic. I just believe because I want to." Well, I believe in human progress, curiosity, and the relentless pursuit of truth. That's my faith.
