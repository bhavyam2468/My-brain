# When Society Becomes The Executioner

The bell rang, signaling the end of the school day, but an eerie **silence** lingered in the corridors. In a small, dusty office, two terrified teens sat on worn-out chairs, their faces pale under the fluorescent glare, their heads bowed under shame thrust upon them. They had been caught..... caught holding hands, stealing glances, and whispering words too soft for CCTV to hear. They weren't plotting crimes or breaking laws; they were fumbling through the confusing maze of **adolescence**. But in a world where innocence is seen as a threat and curiosity as defiance, their actions were deemed unforgivable. Society, as always, was ready to pounce, eager to tear apart young lives in the name of discipline. For that, their lives were about to be shattered.

The school administration, society's self-proclaimed moral **police**, wasted no time. Instead of offering guidance or understanding, they chose humiliation. Parents called, voices raised, accusations hurled, and words were spoken that pierced deeper than any punishment ever could. No one saw them for who they truly were .... just kids, trembling under the weight of emotions they barely understood. How could they? After all, what's more terrifying to society than the raw, unfiltered humanity of love? It's not a crime to care for someone, to feel drawn to them in ways you can't explain, yet these children were treated as if they had committed some **heinous** act. Rules might dictate actions, but feelings cannot be caged, love cannot be controlled. These two weren't criminals. They were simply teenagers, navigating the stormy seas of early emotions, expressing affection to one another, guilty only of being human in a world that has no patience for humanity. The mere act of being close, of being human, was blown into a grotesque scandal. They weren't treated like confused kids; they were branded as criminals. 

That evening, two lifeless bodies lay crumpled beneath the school's **terrace**. The irony? They hadn't jumped because they couldn't face their mistakes. They jumped because society-the so-called protectors of morality-had left them no space to live with dignity. It wasn't love that killed them; it was the crushing weight of collective **judgment**, the unbearable sting of shame, and the cowardice of a society too spineless to admit its own flaws. And what did the adults say afterward? "Such a shame," they whispered, wagging their fingers at the deceased as though the tragedy justified their puritanical outrage. They didn't dare question the system that made humiliation a sport. They didn't question their own sadistic satisfaction in breaking young spirits. No, they moved on, patting themselves on the back for upholding their so-called **values**, too blind to see the blood on their hands. 

This is the society we live in-a judgmental, and hypocritical cesspool that would rather push its children off the edge than give them the tools to stand tall. A society that hides behind the fa√ßade of tradition and morality while refusing to face the fact that its **ignorance** is killing its future. It loves to shame, but it never protects. It loves to teach lessons, yet learns nothing. It loves to protect, yet kills what it seeks to preserve. It loves to judge, yet fears its own reflection. It loves to control, yet spirals into chaos at the slightest defiance. It loves to uphold tradition, yet erases the humanity those traditions were meant to honor. It loves to enforce rules, yet crumbles when confronted with the **truth**. It loves to speak of values, yet buries them beneath hypocrisy. It loves to save face, yet loses its soul in the process. It loves to punish, yet turns a blind eye to its own crimes. This is the society that builds itself on love. It does that only to weaponize it against the very hearts it claims to nurture.

And so, the cycle continues. More cameras installed. More rules written. More children broken. And society, pathetic and spineless, watches on, too busy clutching its pearls to notice it's choking on its own **bile**.
