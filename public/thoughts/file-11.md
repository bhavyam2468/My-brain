A raw reflection on the disappointment of reaching milestone ages and confronting unmet expectations

# The Crushing Weight of Time Passing

**I fucking hate my life.** And the one day I was thinking I'd let myself break down about it is apparently the day I'm *supposed* to be **happy as fuck.** Like no, motherfucker, *I'm happy every other fucking day,* let me cry for a **goddamn** change. Let me fucking shed—oh, who am I kidding? *I can’t even cry.* The tears? **They don’t fucking come.** My body is so fucking stubborn it won’t even give me the satisfaction of breaking down properly. **What kind of bullshit is that?**  

And what the **fuck** am I even doing with my life? I’m *supposed* to be good at something, supposed to have a passion, supposed to be **talented.** But no, I’m just a **fucking compilation of unfinished projects and half-assed attempts.** People come to me like I’m some tech genius—parents, relatives, friends... “Oh hey, can you fix my phone? Can you help me with this computer thing?” And I do it, and they appreciate me, and for a second, *I almost feel useful,* almost feel like I have some kind of skill... **until I realize that no, I’m not actually fucking talented.** It’s basic shit. **They’re just dumb as fuck.**  

I used to be *that kid*, you know? The one who was so into coding that I built a **fucking Tic-Tac-Toe game in class 7th.** That used to be impressive. That used to mean something. **But now?** Now I don’t even do that. I’m not that badass tech whiz. I’m just a **fucking fraud who knows how to Google things well.** I tried to build my future in coding—**flopped.** Tried gaming—**flopped.** Tried YouTube—**flopped.** Tried video editing, photo editing, psychology, fucking dance—**flopped, flopped, flopped.** And I used to tell myself, *“It’s okay, you’re still young, you’ve got time.”* But I’m starting to **fucking doubt that now.**  

And the worst part? I **know** it isn’t too late. I know I’m just **17.** I know life has a lot left to give, but **for fuck’s sake, when does it start giving?** Where’s the **fucking sign** that I’m on the right path? I imagine myself in some alternate timeline, rocking long curly hair, bashing a drum set while performing *Beggin’* in front of a **fucking crowd,** just living that **rockstar energy.** But here I am, getting my tiny little ego boost from being the **“phone guy”** in the group. *“Oh, you wanna buy a new phone? Ask me, I know all the specs!”* Like, **holy shit, what a fucking legacy to leave behind.**  

And the future? **Oh, let’s really talk about the future.** Because every **fucking time** I start thinking about it, *I shiver.* The supply of engineers, coders, AI specialists—**it’s fucking infinite.** And demand? **Barely growing.** I look at it and think, *“What if I don’t get a job?”* **What if my entire fucking life collapses** because I can’t secure a **basic-ass paycheck?** My family, my plans, everything, **fucked.** I keep obsessing over my future, stressing over it, but I have a **physics exam in three days** and **can’t even bring myself to give a shit.** My mind is split between **“Oh god, I need to study”** and **“Oh god, what if my life is already a failed experiment?”** **Fucking fantastic mental balance, right?**  

And you know what **really seals the fucking deal?** This **birthday bullshit.** The one thing that was keeping me sane was that I was still **16,** *still a kid.* Now that’s gone. Now I’m **officially** on the fast track to being an **irrelevant, washed-up adult** who hasn’t accomplished **jack shit.** And birthdays? **Please.** Every other day I ask people to VC, and guess what? **Everyone’s busy.** Every single **fucking time.** But today? **Today, suddenly, everyone has time?** Just like that? **What a joke.** I don’t want that **fake-ass birthday treatment.** **Just leave me the fuck alone and let me spiral in peace.**  

And let’s add another **fun layer of depression, shall we?** Let’s talk about **loneliness.** Let’s talk about how, in my **entire fucking life,** **no girl has ever approached me.** Not once. Not for a conversation, not for a **fucking compliment,** not for anything. **It’s like I’m wearing some invisible “Do Not Engage” sign.** Friendships? **Don’t even get me started.** Every single **fucking friend** I’ve ever had? **They left.** 1st grade? **Gone by 2nd.** 2nd grade? **Gone by 6th.** 6th grade? **Gone by 7th.** 7th grade? **Gone by 9th.** And the ones I have now? **Let’s be real, they won’t last two years into college.** It’s all **temporary,** all **fading,** all **fucking useless.**  

And oh, let’s not forget the **girlfriend situation.** That’s the **real punchline, isn’t it?** The one thing I want, more than anything, the one thing that could **maybe, maybe** make me feel a little less like an **empty sack of fucking nothingness**—and it’s the **one thing I cannot have.** And don’t even give me that *“go to your parents”* bullshit. You know **it’s not the same.** I want someone who **makes me their priority.** Someone I can **talk to.** Someone who makes me feel like **I actually matter to them.** And for **fuck’s sake, what did I do wrong?** I’m **good in studies,** I’ve got a **solid sense of humor,** I’m a **good listener,** I **think logically,** I **go to the gym,** I have an **almost decent face**—so **what’s the fucking issue?**  

I had a crush in 5th grade—**never confessed.** Fine, **my fault.** Had a crush in 9th—**never confessed.** Regretted it. Had a crush in 11th—**spent eight fucking months building up to a confession,** wrote **letters,** wrote a **fucking poem first time in my life,** did **everything possible** to psych myself up—and when I finally did it? **She already had a boyfriend.** **What the actual fuck.** And I can’t even blame her. I can’t even **be mad at her.** It’s just my **shitty, cosmic bad luck at play again.** At this point, **I’ve given up on the whole concept of finding the one.** **Fuck that.** I don’t want **the one anymore.** I’d settle for **anyone.** That’s how **desperate I am.**  

And I very well know there are still some **motherfuckers** who would argue that *people got it worse than me.* *“Be grateful, others have it harder.”* **Oh really? No shit, Sherlock.** But does that mean **I have nothing?** **Pain is not a goddamn competition.**  

**I’m so fucking tired.** I don’t need **sympathy,** I don’t need **pity,** I don’t need some **half-assed “cheer up” speech.**  

So yeah, **happy fucking birthday to me.** Another year of this. Another year of going through the **same bullshit,** convincing myself **it’ll get better** when I know damn well **it won’t.** Another year of being **just barely good enough to function** but **never good enough to matter.** And if one more person sends me some **happy-ass “Have a great day!” message,** **I swear I’m going to lose my fucking mind.**
