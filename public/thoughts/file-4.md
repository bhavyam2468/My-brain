# The Toxic Positivity Trap

From the moment you can comprehend words, they drill it into your skull: Be **happy**. Stay **positive**. Smile more. It's on posters in classrooms, in every useless piece of life advice your relatives give, in every job interview where they ask if you have a "good attitude." Doesn't matter if you just woke up feeling like your chest is full of **concrete**—nobody wants to see that. You are an **actor**, and happiness is your only accepted script.

And what happens when you step out of that role? When you dare to wear your **sadness** on your face? Suddenly, you're a **burden**. A **mood-killer**. The person that makes things "awkward." People rush to **fix** you, shove advice down your throat like they're exorcising a demon—"Have you tried going outside? Have you tried thinking positive?" Yeah, thanks. That definitely didn't occur to me while I was staring at my ceiling at 3 AM questioning my **existence**.

And the worst part? Even the **kind ones** do it. The ones who genuinely care, who sit with you, who listen, the "understanding" people who say, "I'm here for you," the ones who nod sympathetically and assure you, "You're not alone." and I believe them. But at the end of the day, their goal is still the same—to **pull me out of it**. To remind me that things will get better, to tell me that I'm not alone, to gently nudge me toward something lighter. And I get it. They mean well. They think they're helping. Because according to them, sadness is a thing to be **cured**, to be wiped away like a **stain** on an otherwise presentable personality. They don't sit with you in silence; they search for the smile—that one moment where you break, where they can say, "See? I made you feel better!" as if that's the goal.

Why do I have to be **cheered up**? Why is the only acceptable emotional arc one where I start sad and end happy? Why can't I just **be**? If I'm in pain, why am I expected to ignore it for the comfort of others? If I want to retreat into my own world, why is that seen as a **problem**? Why is solitude only acceptable when it's peaceful? If I enjoy sitting in my own sadness, if I find comfort in the weight of it, why does that make people so **uneasy**? Not everyone seeks joy. Not everyone needs to be "fixed." Sometimes, sadness is just a place you need to exist in for a while—and that should be okay.

And it's not just people—it's a whole damn **industry**. The happiness industrial complex. Motivational speakers, life coaches, and those godforsaken self-help books that all say the same thing: "Push yourself out of your comfort zone!" Okay, fair. Growth requires discomfort. But then, they add the poison pill: "Do it. Always. Forever. Never stop." What? Excuse me? The entire point of human civilization was to make life more **livable**—better, safer, easier. We invented fire so we wouldn't freeze, cars so we wouldn't have to walk, technology so we could spend less time struggling and more time existing. But no, apparently "comfort" is now the **enemy**. Apparently, if I'm not constantly hustling, I'm wasting my life. How did we turn peace of mind into a failure?

And then there's **religion**, the OG happiness cult. From birth, it tells you that sadness is a test, a punishment, or a sign of weak faith. "Trust God's plan," they say. "Your suffering has meaning." Oh, so my depression is just a character arc in some divine screenplay? Great. And if I dare to say I'm unhappy with life? "Pray more." "Be grateful." "Other people have it worse." Imagine breaking your leg and, instead of getting a doctor, people just tell you to "appreciate the legs you still have."

But okay, let's say I don't subscribe to that. Let's say I just want to be left alone with my emotions. Oh no. That's also **unacceptable**. You know what's even more taboo than sadness? **Apathy**. Because if you're not smiling, society at least expects you to be humble, kind, accommodating. But why? Why do I have to be polite when I'm **exhausted**? Why do I have to soften my tone when people keep pushing me? Why do I have to be the one to hold back when I'm the one struggling? But no—if I don't perform niceness, I'm "**cold**." If I ignore someone nagging me for the fifth time, I'm "**rude**." And if I finally snap? I am the problem. Not the people who refused to give me space, me. Unbelievable.

And then there's the ultimate **hypocrisy**: taking offense at jokes. If I apologize in a fake, sarcastic tone, you'll immediately understand that I don't mean it. But if I make a joke about something, suddenly, intent doesn't matter? Suddenly, words alone define my entire **character**? People will literally ruin lives over a single joke because they're "offended." Meanwhile, real problems like mental health stigma, economic inequality, and actual oppression get ignored because "they're too complex to fix."

But that's the trick, isn't it? Society doesn't just dislike sadness—it **hates** it. It treats it like a virus, an infection that needs to be wiped out. And it works, because they manifest this idea into every generation. It becomes a subconscious rule. Unhappiness is bad. Sad people are broken. Smiling means you're doing life right. The same way they conditioned people to believe that a long life is good, even when someone has already had their **closure**. But hey, that's a rant for another day.
