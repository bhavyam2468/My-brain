# The Endless Cycle of Looking Back

Regret fills my **present**â€”regret that, in the past, I regretted my present. And now, I regret regretting it. Every regret from my past overlaps my present, making me regret the time I spent regretting it back then. I regret the way I **regretted** in the past, wishing I hadn't spent so much time regretting it. 

Presently, I'm starting to regret regretting so much. The past feels like a present I shouldn't have regretted, yet here I am, regretting what I **regretted** then in the present that is my past in the present, in the present. 

I don't regret regretting me regretting regretting the regret I did in the past-present, but I regret not regretting that regret sooner in the present-present because presently, I **represent** the present-present, which is a present-present that is my past-present's present to me.
