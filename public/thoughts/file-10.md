National Frustration

A critical examination of societal and systemic issues in modern India

**I want to leave India**, and the moment I say it, people start going off **"Oh, you hate your country, you’re just wasting resources!"** No, **fuck you**, I pay for those resources, so don’t talk to me like I’m some ungrateful brat. I’m **tired** of this shit, but let’s go over it once again, since no one seems to fucking get it.

The **Supreme Court** just told Ranveer Allahbadia that his jokes would make women **"feel ashamed and uncomfortable."** Oh really? **Now** you care about women’s dignity? You know what's been happening in this country for **years?** We’ve got **rapists walking free**, marriage being a **free card to assault**, women **begging for justice**, survivors **shamed into silence**, and the people in power **don’t give a single shit** about it. But suddenly, you want to throw a **fucking fit** over some **jokes?** That's where we're at now? **Come on!**

But let's talk about **law and order**, or the **lack** of it. Every **fucking week**, some **rich guy commits a crime**, and guess what? **He gets away with it.** Drunk drivers mowing down people? **"Oh, they know the right people."** A **celebrity** doing something illegal? **Just wait**, they’ll roll out a **PR campaign** to make it **fucking disappear**. What happens to the **average person?** **We get fucked.** No justice. No equality. Just a **rigged system** where only the **rich and powerful win.** It’s a **fucking pay-to-win battleground**, where we get **our hands to fight** and rich people? **They get fucking bazookas.**

And **don’t even get me started** on the **so-called "culture."** India loves to talk about how **progressive** it is, but **come on**—look at what we’re **clinging** to. The moment you **question anything**, you’re disrespecting **"Bharatiya sanskriti"?** **Fuck that.** This **culture is toxic.** It’s **stuck in the past**, holding everyone **back.** Women get **judged** for their clothes, **interfaith** or **inter-caste relationships** get **harassed**, and parents still try to **control their kids’ lives** like they’re **fucking property.** It’s **2025**, and we’re still **stuck** in this **backward bullshit.**

Someone argued that the **US has more reported rape cases**, and **I don’t know if you noticed**, but he used the word **"reported."** I’m not sure about this, but someone's **parents didn’t let her report her rape** to the police because it would **lower their respect** in society. **Really?**

Oh, and **god forbid** you want to do **something different**, because the moment you **step out of line**, your **own family** treats you like you’re a **fucking disgrace.**

**Infrastructure?** **HA.** I pay **taxes**, but where does my **money** go? To fund **shit that doesn’t matter.** **Roads?** **Laughable.** **Potholes everywhere.** Traffic that moves **slower than a snail on a lazy day.** Want **decent internet?** **Good luck.** We’re stuck in **2008.** But **sure**, let’s talk about **"progress," right?**

The **education system?** **I don’t even know where to start.** It **rewards memorization** over **intelligence.** You’re not taught to **think**; you’re taught to **obey.** You want to be **creative?** **Too bad**, this system **doesn’t have room for that.** **Engineering** or **medicine**, that’s your **only choice.** Or else you’re a **failure.** And if you **dare** to **dream outside of that narrow box**, don’t expect **support from anyone.** Your **family** will **shut you down** faster than you can **blink.**

The **economy?** **HAHAHAHA, don’t make me laugh.** Want to **build wealth** in this country? **Good fucking luck.** If you’re not **born into money**, it’s a **fucking struggle.** I know, **low cost of living,** but **lower wages**, **unemployment.** If you even **try** to **make something of yourself**, you’ll be **crushed** by **outdated policies**, **insane taxes**, and **bureaucratic bullshit.** And if you **make it through all that**, the **stock market is a joke.** One **wrong move**, and **everything crashes.** Everything is **unstable, unreliable**, and the **rich keep getting richer** while the **rest of us try to scrape by.**

And again, **HAHA** if I say I want to **leave**, suddenly **I’m the problem?** **I’m the bad guy** for **wanting something better?** **I’m the one** who **"hates my country"?** No, **fuck that.** I **don’t owe this place anything.** I **didn’t choose** to be **born here.** I **didn’t get a say** in the matter. And if you want to **talk about how this country gave me resources**, I’ll **remind you** that I **pay taxes** for those. And what do I get in **return?** **Nothing.** Just **more fucking problems.**

I’m not gonna **keep investing in Bitcoin when it’s falling**, just because it made me **rich once.** I’d take my **money out** and put it **somewhere that actually gives a shit.**

Some people say **"the grass isn’t greener on the other side."** Well, **you know what?** Fine, **the grass might not be greener on the other side.** But guess what? **ON THIS SIDE, THERE'S NO FUCKING GRASS.** It’s just **barren land** with **nothing to offer.** What am I supposed to do with that? **Build sandcastles?** **Yeah, that’s real fucking productive.**

I could actually **do something** with this **barren land** if I had the **resources** or **mental capacity**, but **right now, I have neither.** I’m being **suffocated** by this **country**, and it’s **driving me crazy.** I don’t even have to **explain myself** to **anyone.** If you **don’t get it by now,** I’m **done justifying.**

**India is beyond saving.** People like to **pretend** there’s **hope**, that **somehow**, we can **protest our way out of this.** But I'd like to think **it's over.** India is a **fucking dead country.** The **future is a joke.** And until there's a **mass of people... hundreds of millions... united in real change,** this country will continue to **rot.**

The probability of that happening? **Slim to none.** The **education system** is a **joke.** People are **brainwashed,** stuck in their **religion-fueled delusions**, and who **controls them?** The **fucking government.** It’s a **vicious cycle** you **can’t escape from.**

The only thing you’ll have to **show for it** at the **end of your life** is **"I tried."** But guess what? **No one gives a fuck if you tried.** The **result will be Nil. Zero. Shunya.**

It **doesn’t matter.** India is **beyond saving.**

So yeah, **fuck India.** I don’t **owe it anything.** I didn’t **sign up for this.** If you **think I’m wrong, go ahead—keep defending this shitshow of a country.** But I’m **done.** I’m **done trying to save a place that doesn’t even want to save itself.**
